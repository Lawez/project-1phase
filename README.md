# Box Office Trends Analysis: Insights for Microsoft's New Movie Studio project

Author: [***Ian Tulienge***](#Ian-Tulienge)

## Overview

Microsoft is entering the highly competitive movie industry with the goal of producing successful films that generate revenue. However, as a newcomer to the industry, they lack experience and understanding of the factors that contribute to a movie's success. Box office revenue, critical acclaim, and audience reception are key performance metrics, with movie genres playing a significant role in determining success. This project aims to analyze the performance of different movie genres, identify trends and patterns, and provide actionable insights for Microsoft's new movie studio to inform their decisions when creating new films. By understanding the context and factors influencing the movie industry, the project can help Microsoft create successful movies and achieve their goals.
Now you will put your new skills to use with a large end-of-Phase project!

For this project, you will use exploratory data analysis to generate insights for a business stakeholder.

### Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

### The Data

In the folder `zippedData` are movie datasets from:

* [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)
* [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)

Because it was collected from various locations, the different files have different formats. Some are compressed CSV (comma-separated values) or TSV (tab-separated values) files that can be opened using spreadsheet software or `pd.read_csv`, while the data from IMDB is located in a SQLite database.

# Methods

This project uses descriptive analysis,correlation matrix to check for relationship between the variables. This provides a useful overview of insights and outcomes to identify resource needs.

# Results

The chart indicates that there is a weak positive correlation between the two variables, with higher-rated movies generally having more votes. However, there are also many movies with a high number of votes but a lower rating, indicating that the popularity of a movie is not always directly related to its quality or critical reception. This information can be useful for understanding the relationship between movie ratings and popularity and for identifying which movies may be more likely to succeed in terms of audience engagement and overall reception.
